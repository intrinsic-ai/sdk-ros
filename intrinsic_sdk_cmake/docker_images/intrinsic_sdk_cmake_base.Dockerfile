# This Dockerfile provides only the source code for intrinsic_sdk_cmake.
# It needs to be built from the root of the intrinsic_sdk_ros repository.

# base stage: ghcr.io/sloretz/ros:jazzy-ros-core + configs + rmw_zenoh
FROM ghcr.io/sloretz/ros:jazzy-ros-core AS base
# TODO(wjwwood): this is based on the ROS image because we still use
#   ament_cmake, we should move away from that and either vendor ament_cmake or
#   avoid it entirely.
# Note: ghcr.io/sloretz/ros:jazzy-ros-core is appropriate here as it does not
#   have any build tools and though it has some ros packages installed, it is
#   unlikely that any of them would not be require for even the most trivial
#   ROS applications.
# Note: We are using the ghcr.io/sloretz/ros OCI ROS images since they are more
#   granular and stay up-to-date more often than the "official" ROS docker
#   images like ros:jazzy, for example.
