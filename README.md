# Intrinsic SDK for ROS

The Intrinsic SDK for ROS is a wrapper of the [Intrinsic
SDK](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/sdk) that allows for software developers
to write ROS-based workflows that work with
[Flowstate](https://intrinsic.ai/flowstate), a web-based tool to build robot
solutions from concept to deployment.


In addition to the this [Intrinsic SDK for
ROS repository](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/intrinsic_sdk_ros), there are
also:
 * [ROS-based SDK Examples](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/sdk_examples_ros)
 * [The Intrinsic SDK](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/sdk)
 * [Intrinsic SDK examples](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/sdk-examples)
 * [Dev container project template](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/project-template)
